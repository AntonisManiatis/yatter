Yet another Time Tracker is a CLI punch in & out time tracker.

<!-- TODO: Maybe a gif here? -->

Another one? Aren't there like a bunch of better options out there?

Certainly! I just needed an excuse to start learning Rust. ðŸ˜„

## Installation

There isn't a released version of yatter yet and so if you want to install it you'd have to build the binaries yourself. To do that you'd need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.

After that you can clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/AntonisManiatis/yatter.git
```

cd into your cloned repo and do:

```
cargo build --release
```

After `cargo` is finished you'll find the compiled binary for your OS & architecture in `./target/release`.

Finally set a [Path environment variable](<https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Environment_Variables.html#:~:text=To%20set%20(or%20change)%20a,it%20to%20an%20empty%20string.>) pointing to the binary so you can use `yatter` from your shell.

### Starship

If you have [starship](https://starship.rs/) you can add this to your starship.toml.

<!-- TODO: Not final! -->

```
[custom.yatter]
command = "yatter status"
when = "yatter status"
symbol = "îœ‘" # test one, I don't want to get sued.
format = " [$symbol($output)]($style) "
style = "bold yellow"
```

Here's how that would look like:

## Usage

Let's assume you have your work projects structured like this:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ work
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project_x
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs            # project related docs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ be_repo         # back-end git repo
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fe_repo         # front-end git repo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project_y
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project_z
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

And you have a task that you'd like to track your time for `project_x`.

Open up a terminal and type:

```
yatter init ./work/project_x
```

To punch in for that project:

```
yatter punch ./work/project_x
```

After you are done with your task you again use `punch` to punch out:

```
yatter punch ./work/project_x -d "Added search functionality to navbar."
```

To check if you have punched in or out for a project:

```
yatter status ./work/project_x
```

For additional info please use:

```
yatter --help
```
