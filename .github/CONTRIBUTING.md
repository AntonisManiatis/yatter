# Contributing to Yatter

Thank you for your interest in this little tool.

## Reporting bugs

If you encounter any bugs please [open an issue](https://github.com/AntonisManiatis/yatter/issues/new/choose) and include as much detail as possible. Include your OS, steps to reproduce, relavent errors, etc.

## Requesting features

I created this tool to try and solve a specific use case and so I already have a small backlog of features/ideas that have top priority for me. I cannot guarantee that I'll add features that do not align with my usecases.

You can have a look at the backlog [here](https://github.com/users/AntonisManiatis/projects/4).

Nevertheless if there's a feature you'd like to suggest feel to free to [open an issue](https://github.com/AntonisManiatis/yatter/issues/new/choose) and let's discuss about it!
